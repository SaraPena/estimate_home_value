# estimate_home_value
Working with Zillow dataset to predict home value.

Files you will need:

Your personal:

env.py - contains your host, username, and password variables to access sql database

You may clone those from this repo:

 - acquire.py

 - prep.py

 - split_scale.py

 - features.py

 - model.py

In this project we will aquire and explore data that can create a better model to predict home values.

At the beginning of this project our only baseline prediction is the average value of properties in the dataset.

We will attempt to create a better model by looking at features all properties can measured with:

1. Squarefeet
2. Bedroom count
3. Bathroom count
